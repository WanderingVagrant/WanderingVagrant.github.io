# About Me
Hi, I'm Sahil Bhalla, a Physics and Computer Science student at UCSD. I'm interested in game programming, physics simulation,   and interesting projects.
This is a page to store/show-off some personal projects and other accomplishments to potential employers and those graduate school admissions.
