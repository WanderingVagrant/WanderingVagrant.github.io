This here is the links page where I will discuss all of the sources I used while building this website, my physics engine, and my other projects.


#### [**Souto's Physics Tutorial**](https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics)
As I already explained on my [critique](https://wanderingvagrant.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/06/06/Souto's-Physics-Engine-Tutorial-and-why-it's-great.html), this is a great tutorial for anyone in the process of building a physics engine and I relied on it heavily when making mine.

#### [**Understanding Constraint Resolution in Physics Engine**](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/math-and-physics/understanding-constraint-resolution-in-physics-engine-r4839/)
This a more detailed and specific article dealing with constraint based collision resolution. I was having trouble understanding the whole concept and this website was a nice guide from the perspective of someone in my position explaining how it works. The article starts with some basic equations and concepts then builds on them as you read until you eventually arrive at a general equation for solving constraints. This is useful for those who specifically want to understand this topic and already have the basic knowledge of physics engines and constraint based simulation.

#### [**Maik's Advice for a Physics Engine**](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/11263)
When researching on how to start making a physics engine this was one of the first posts I came across and it was great for getting started. The author is answering a question that anyone would have on starting to make a physics engine and provides several resources on getting started as well as some great advice.

#### [**Rappel Laboratory**](https://rappel.ucsd.edu/)
This is the website for the lab I worked at freshman year and it was the first place I looked when contacting them to get my position there. If you're a UCSD student or postdoc interested in biophysics and cell motility I recommend looking here for more information ont he lab and possible contacting them if you're interested.

#### [**Learn Unity**](https://learn.unity.com/)
This is a resource I used to learn specific Unity skills I needed for the 2D Rpg I'm working on as a part of the Video Game Development Club at UCSD. It's basically a enormous compilation of free Unity tutorials on all aspects of the game engine, which I recommend for anyone wanting to learn Unity or start creating games right away. Most of the tutorials are hands on and often you leave with a finished project which is very helpful in learning the material and having evidence that you did.
