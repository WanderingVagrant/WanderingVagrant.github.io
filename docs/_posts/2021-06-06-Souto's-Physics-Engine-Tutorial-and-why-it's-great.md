Hi readers!    
In this post, I'm going to discuss the biggest help in creating my physics engine out of all my research, and why it was so effective at teaching the concepts of physics engines. Check out the [link's page](https://wanderingvagrant.github.io/Links/) if you want to check it out for yourself.

This tutorial is great at showing exactly why the information it gives you is useful for a physics engine and it doesn't wait too much time before getting into exactly what needs to be. For a reader who was searching around and finding really vague, theoretical guides and tutorials this was a breath of fresh air, and really help a reader stay engaged and interested in learning more. Furthermore, alongside the equations and conceptual explanations we are given helpful code snippets
